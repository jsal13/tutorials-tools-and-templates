# Quickstart

Go into command prompt (search in Windows) and run `jupyter lab`.  

Once it comes up, you'll see something like: http://localhost:8889/?token=lotsofnumbersandthings.  Copy and paste this into a web browser if it doesn't automatically open up.

Navigate to this folder in Jupyter Lab and double click `Introduction.ipynb`.  It should open up the lesson.  Follow the instructions in the lesson and you're good to go.
